# RockbiteGames-Technical-Assignment
This project implements an Item Upgrade System for a game, allowing the creation, management, and upgrading of game items. 

**Features:**

*   **Item Creation:** Creates items with different rarities (Common, Great, Rare, Epic, Legendary).
*   **Inventory Management:** 
    *   Adds and removes items from the player's inventory.
    *   Tracks the quantity of each item in the inventory.
*   **Item Upgrading:** 
    *   Implements upgrade rules for different item rarities.
    *   Handles the consumption of items required for upgrades.
    *   Upgrades items to higher rarities (Common -> Great -> Rare -> Epic -> Legendary).
    *   Manages upgrade counts for Epic items.

**How to Run:**

1.  **Compile the code:** Use a Java compiler (such as javac) to compile the Java source files (`Item.java`, `Inventory.java`, `UpgradeManager.java`, and `Main.java`).
2.  **Run the program:** Execute the compiled `Main` class using the `java` command.
